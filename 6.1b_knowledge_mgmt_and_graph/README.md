### SDSC Summer Institute 2024
# Session 6.1b Knowledge Management and Knowledge Graph

**Date:** Friday, August 9, 2024

**Summary**: In this session, we have three connected sections. The first section will help participants understand knowledge management and how to implement it, specifically within the scientific community. It will also highlight the fundamental shift in the machine learning paradigm and how to incorporate knowledge management into daily processes. This section will cover the basic concepts of knowledge management, from ontology development to document management. In the next part, we will cover two fundamental knowledge management techniques that can help users design their knowledge pipelines and improve their daily processes. The first technique focuses on how to use large language models (LLMs) beyond traditional engineering methods and other related technologies.

Finally, we are going to delve into the fascinating topic of knowledge graph technology. In this section, we'll explore how to effectively build and use knowledge graphs to manage knowledge pipelines. We'll also discuss how to use LLMs to construct and navigate knowledge management systems.
