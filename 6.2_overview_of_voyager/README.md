### SDSC Summer Institute 2024
# Session 6.2 Overview of Voyager

**Date:** Friday, August 9, 2024

**Summary**: Voyager provides an innovative system architecture uniquely optimized for deep learning operations using well-established frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Voyager comprises 42 training nodes of Supermicro X12 Habana Gaudi Training Servers; each training node contains 8 GAUDI HL-205 training processor cards which have 100 GbE non-blocking, all-to-all connections among the 8 cards within a node; the 42 Training nodes are connected via a high-performance, low latency 400 GbE switch interconnect. Voyagerâ€™s architecture has already shown highly scalable AI application performance in various areas such as LLMs (with billions of parameters such as for GPT2-XL and GPT3-XL), convolutional neural network-based image processing, and graph neural network based high-energy particle physics
