# Preparing for the SDSC Summer Institute 2024

You will get the most out of the SDSC Summer Institute if you prepare prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before we start, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

This section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions for setting up your account, connecting to Expanse and configuring your laptop to run the visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks.

##  HPC Systems Accounts: <a name="accounts"></a>
You will need a training account to access SDSC’s Expanse HPC system for the HPC & Data Science Summer Institute. This account will be created for you by our team. 

An email will be sent from consult@sdsc.edu with the subject line "HPC & Data Science 2024 Summer Institute: Account Set-Up" that will include your training account username and password and instructions.
We will send this email in time for  "Prep Day," where we will be covering how to manage your training account, along with other useful information. 

As a reminder, we are asking all attendees to use the training accounts that we are providing, even if you already have your own account. This will minimize problems related to custom configurations (e.g. environment variables, choice of shell, etc.) that may cause some of the hands-on examples to break. 

This training account may be used:
  * Via SSH directly to login.expanse.sdsc.edu
  * Via a special page on the Expanse Portal: https://portal.expanse.sdsc.edu/training
  * * For this institute, please do not use portal.expanse.sdsc.edu.
